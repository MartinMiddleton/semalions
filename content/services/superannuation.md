We serve to prevent avoidable blindness and improve quality of life for people who are blind and visually impaired.
Ever since Helen Keller inspired us to champion the cause in 1925, we’ve served and advocated for the blind and visually impaired. Nearly a century later, this long-standing mission continues unhindered.

## Vision Facts

- **253 million** people are blind or have moderate to severe distance vision impairment (MSVI)
- **1.1 billion** people have near-vision impairment simply because they don’t have a pair of glasses
- **More than 75%** of all blindness and MSVI is avoidable
- **89%** of people with visual impairment live in developing countries
