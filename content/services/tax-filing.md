Lions improve access to quality education, vital health services, and positive youth development for young people around the world. Lions Quest, LCIFâ€™s signature youth education program, is a social emotional learning curriculum which gives students the skills to navigate life and prevent bullying and substance abuse.

## Global Statistics

- 1 in 3 students reports being cyberbullied; 20% report skipping school because of it or violence.
- 2 in 3 students in 160 countries worry about violence in and around schools.
- Reading scores and bullying are directly correlated.
- Schools with positive school climate practices like Lions Quest have lower rates of absenteeism and bullying.

## What Young People Learn in Lions Quest

The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) recently published the results of a survey of top employers outlining the skills desired in new college graduates. Likewise, the World Economic Forum identified the top skills needed for the jobs of the future. The most necessary and desired skills are not related to any STEM field or technical proficiency. Instead, they are competencies directly related to the social and emotional skills built by Lions Quest:

- Problem-solving and decision-making
- Critical thinking and creativity
- Ability to work in a team environment
- Communications skills with people inside and outside an organization
- Leadership and the ability to effectively motivate others
- Strong work ethic and perseverance
